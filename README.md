* PriCoSha, a system for privately sharing content items
among groups of people.
* PriCoSha gives users somewhat more privacy than many content
sharing sites by giving them more detailed control over who can see which content items they
post and more control over whether other people can tag content items with a userâ€™s personal
information.
