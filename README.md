PriCoSha, a system for privately sharing content items
among groups of people. PriCoSha gives users somewhat more privacy than many content
sharing sites by giving them more detailed control over who can see which content items they
post and more control over whether other people can tag content items with a user’s personal
information. You may choose the kind of content your version of PriCoSha focuses on, e.g.
photos, video clips, announcements about social or professional events, etc. The focus of the
project will be on storing data about the content, allowing users to specify who can see and/or
modify what, and providing ways for users to find content of interest. 
Users will be able to log in, post content items, view (some of) the content items posted by
others (public content and content posted by people who have given them access via a ``friend’’
mechanism, detailed below; tag content items with usernames of people referred to in the
content items (if they have permission to do so), etc. 

NOTE: THIS VERSION IS VERY MESSY AND HAS QUITE A FEW BUGS.
